# Learn Rust by writing Entirely Too Many Linked Lists
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rust-unofficial/too-many-lists.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rust-unofficial/too-many-lists)

# Building

Building requires mdbook, which can be installed from crates.io:

```sh
cargo install mdbook
```

Assuming you've placed `mdbook` into your system PATH variable, then run it from the root of your local copy:

```sh
mdbook build
```

---

If you'd prefer, this project can also be built with
[GitBook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook), although GitBook
is not officially supported and compatibility is therefore
uncertain and incidental.
